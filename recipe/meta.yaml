  summary: 'A workflow engine for cycling systems'
  description: |
    Cylc ("silk") orchestrates complex distributed suites of interdependent
    cycling (or non-cycling) tasks. It was originally designed to automate
    environmental forecasting systems at NIWA, however Cylc is a general
    workflow engine; it is not specialized to forecasting in any way.
